## Unexpected Behavior

I am getting a 500 error when trying to make a POST request. The POST is to submissions which is nested under positions.

## Expected Behavior

I expect to POST data to submissions

## Reproduce the Error

> Describe the steps we can take to reproduce the error, i.e.:

```md
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run bundle
3. rails db:create
4. On postman create a POST request with the url http://localhost:3000/positions/1/submissions
5. The JSON body will have {
    "submission": {
        "name": "test",
        "description": "testtesttest",
        "img_url": "test.png"
    }
}
6. See the subsequent error in the console. Cry
```

## Documentation

> Include the exact error message, and if helpful, any supplemental documentation, such as screen captures.

```md
"status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "exception": "#<ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 2, expected 0..1)>",
    "traces": {
```

I am following my zoos/pandas homework, where I nested pandas under zoos. I remember being confused as to what the proper code was. I don't remember if you put the parent id in the params or the json request.

## Attempted Resolution

> If you haven't already, **Google your error message now**. See if those error messages return an answer. Include at least 2 resources you've tried to consult such as walk-throughs, stack overflow articles, and other discussion threads related to your error.
