# Project Name
t was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather. The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed. By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow - hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.

#### Planning
- [ ] Have a thoroughly developed README.md file

#### Server (Back-End)
- [ ] Have a RESTful JSON API
  - [ ] Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints
  - [ ] Build a database with at least two tables and at least one association between tables
  - [ ] Utilize Rails to define models for interacting with the database
  - [ ] Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between your non-User tables (not including authentication)

#### Client (Front-End)
- [ ] Have a working, interactive React app, built using `npx create-react-app`
  - [ ] Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure
  - [ ] Utilize functional or class React components appropriately
  - [ ] Utilize state and props in your components efficiently
  - [ ] Use only React for DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Consume data from your Ruby on Rails API, and render that data in your components
- [ ] Utilize React Router, for client-side routing
- [ ] Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` ) on the front-end

#### Styling

- [ ] Be styled with CSS (or SCSS, if you'd prefer)
- [ ] Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design
- [ ] Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop)

#### Linting

- [ ] Indent properly
- [ ] Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names
- [ ] Follow `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case` convention
- [ ] Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code
- [ ] Remove all `console.log()`s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are okay)

#### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy the fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify
- [ ] Deploy the back-end via Heroku

#### Procedural

- [ ] Initialize a git repo on Github, with a link to your hosted project
- [ ] Have frequent commits, making a robust commit history at least every day (75 commits minimum)
- [ ] Use effective and safe branching and merging processes
